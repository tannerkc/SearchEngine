# Basic Search Engine

A search engine built using PHP. A web crawler follows a provided link and then follows every link it finds on that 
page and so on, storing each link in a database, along with the pade description, keywords and title.<br>
The PHP script searches through every description, keyword and title to find everything in relation to your search term. After you click a link 
the database updates a click count and the search results are sorted by click count. <br><br>
Hovering a link shows a "peak" into the site to save time.
The search engine also contains a calculator and fedex tracker.

disclosure: the basis for this project was formed from a tutorial. The basic functionality and the crawler were inspired by the tutorial but the added functions such as calculator, fedex tracker and link preview are entirely mine.
