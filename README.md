# Basic Search Engine

A search engine built using PHP. A web crawler follows a provided link and then follows every link it finds on that 
page and so on, storing each link in a database, along with the pade description, keywords and title.<br>
The PHP script searches through every description, keyword and title to find everything in relation to your search term. After you click a link 
the database updates a click count and the search results are sorted by click count. <br><br>
Hovering a link shows a "peak" into the site to save time.
